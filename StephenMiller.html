            <p>I have a deeply embedded-and I think, perfectly understandable-distrust of the American "intelligence
                community." That being said, holy hell, this is something I don't like to hear. From CNN: The Secret
                Service director reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned
                on Sunday amid growing pressure from the President.</p>

            <p>In the White House, Miller has been the architect of many of the administration's most extreme policies.
                Just days after Trump's inauguration, he and then-adviser Steve Bannon crafted an executive order that
                banned travel into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries, resulting in massive protests across
                the country.</p>

            <p>First, it should be understood that Miller's hardline approach to immigration predates his work for
                Trump. In 2013, as an aide to then-Senator Jeff Sessions, Miller made his name on Capitol Hill fighting
                ferociously against a bipartisan immigration-reform bill alongside populist-right media allies like
                Breitbart News.</p>

                anonymous New York Times op-ed suggesting a cabal to control the president, Trump is relying more and
                more on the extremist adviser Stephen Miller.</p>

                difference? Would he even notice? The 32-year-old White House senior policy adviser is in the news once
                again, this time offering a full-throated endorsement of the Trump administration's decision to separate
                families seeking refuge on our southern border.</p>

                also has held a shocking worldview since he was a teenager. From his writings on the 2006 Duke
